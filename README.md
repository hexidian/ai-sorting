# ai-sorting
sort things nice with ai

~~my goal will be to beat the built-in python sorting function, timsort. The algorithm I will be using can't be turned into general because it relies on knowing the equation of best fit for the data being sorted.~~

I can't beat timsort. I tried and I can't. timsort is world's better than my algorithm. Instead I will try to make a Natural Merge Sort in C.
